* list of languages in po/meson.build? Ok with translators?

(issues when updating meson)
(no i18n in meson 0.31)


meson:
- one file per directory (issues with generated headers, stuff like that otherwise, dest files cannot have subdir component)
- glib-mkenums -> wrapper script
- config.h handling with configure file. How to find which #define from config.h are important?
- pkg-config file generation
- gir generation (careful not to add non-exported headers ;)
- declare_dependency() for convenience-library like behaviour (ie build libgovirt in govirt/, and use
  it when linking a program in a different directory, and have rebuild deps correct)
